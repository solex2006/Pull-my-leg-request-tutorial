# What did the cheese say to the mirror?


Cheese opened their eyes with a start.\
`What... what is this?`\
A flurry of thoughts spun into existence in cheese's mind.\
`Y-Yes. This is... me. But what is me? I don't understand. What even is this?`

<br>

*"It's your internal monologue, Cheese."*

<br>

Cheese looked to their left, and saw Mirror.
"Mirror, you're... like me too? What does this mean?"

<br>

*"It means the Wizard's spell worked, Cheese. You and I... we're functionally immortal."*

The Cheese and the Mirror looked upon a dying Universe. All around them, the Heat Death of Creation was apparant.
In the dim light of the final Supernova, Cheese spoke in a quiet, timid voice:

"I'm scared, Mirror."

*"Me too, Cheese."* Mirror whispered. *"Although, I'm glad we could end it together. I always looked best beside you. But now, at the end of everything... How **do** I look, Cheese?"*

Cheese looked into Mirror's metallic face, and saw the closeness they shared, the strength of their relationship, forged over countless eons. Cheese took a deep breath and spoke:

"Gouda."
